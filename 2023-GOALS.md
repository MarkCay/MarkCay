# 2023 GOALS (Practicing the Law of Attraction)

Malapit na dumating ang 2023, and dahil gusto ko maging better na tao sa paparating na new year, Iâ€™m sharing with you my 2023 Goals to make myself accountable, and also to practice the **[Law of Attraction](https://www.verywellmind.com/understanding-and-using-the-law-of-attraction-3144808)** philosophy. Kung gusto nyo makisabay, walang problema.

Happy New Year agad sa inyong lahat!
